                <p>The Borderless Initiative is an opportunity for us to spread the Christmas gift to hostel 
                    children of Karnataka Navjeevana Samithi (Chintamani, Sidlaghatta, Melur and Rayalpadu) 
                    and Indian Sponsorship Project (Ankola, Karnataka). In order for us to do this, we are 
                    alling all soldiers to assemble. Across several weeks, we will be hosting fun activities 
                    and competitions that you can participate in. Every dollar raised from each activity will 
                    go toward our goal of spreading the joy of Christ across the world. We are humbly requesting 
                    everyone’s prayers and support in hopefully reaching our goal. God bless.
